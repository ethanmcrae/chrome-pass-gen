### Ideas for further improvements:

- [ ] Add an option to sync the password history across devices using the user's Google account.
- [ ] Add "Refresh" and "Close" icons in the history page for each listing. (More data will need to be saved to each history segment: Setting data)
- [ ] Integrate the extension with a password manager to automatically save and fill passwords for websites.
- [ ] Implement a password expiration feature that prompts users to regenerate passwords for specific websites after a user-defined period.
- [ ] Add a search functionality in the History UI to quickly find a specific password or website.
- [ ] Allow users to export their password history as a CSV, JSON, or XML file for backup or import into other password managers.
- [ ] Implement an auto-lock feature that requires a user-defined master password to access the extension after a specified period of inactivity.
- [ ] Accommodate a dynamic dark/light mode based on user preferences.
